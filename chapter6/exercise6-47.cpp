// Exercise 6.47: Revise the program you wrote in the exercises in ยง 6.3.2 (p. 228)
// that used recursion to print the contents of a vector to conditionally print information about its execution.
// For example, you might print the size of the vector on each call.
// Compile and run the program with debugging turned on and again with it turned off.
