// I would prefer the version of swap which uses references instead of pointers
// because with pointers, there is need for checking its validity and whether or not it is a nullptr
// with references, however, if the bound object is valid, it is guaranted that the reference is valid as well
// also, with pointers, there is added complication of passing address-of object, and operating on dereferenced versions
// since, dereference and address-of operators needs to be used with caution, there are most chances of error, and program crashing
