# Exercise 6.31: When is it valid to return a reference? A reference to `const`?

Functions shall not return references or pointers to local objects - as local objects get destroyed on function return, except for `static`. However, it is allowed to return a reference to pre-existing objects - such as those passed as argument to the function from the calling function or global objects. A reference to `const` suffers the same problem. Temporary objects are destroyed on function return. Returning reference to `const` prevents copying for large literal container types, therefore more efficient and more flexible.
