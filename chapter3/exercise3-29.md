# Exercise 3.29: List some of the drawbacks of using an array instead of a vector.

- Elements cannot be deleted
- Dynamic creation of array is not possible
- Multiple data types cannot be stored
- Fixed size; cannot be dynamically resized
- Does not provide additional functionality, such as resizing, checking for current size, etc
- No bound checking; addressing an address beyond the scope
- No copy or constructor assignments/initializations
